# N Queens Magic
*A program that solves the N Queens puzzle*
## Introduction
So I was figuring out how to program my own chess engine, and suddenly I stumbled upon an article saying that some Math institute offers $1M to anyone who can 'solve a chess puzzle'. It had something to do with the P vs NP problem, and it was all a bit trickier than what the title suggested (who would guess).

You can find out more about the issue here: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2017/title,1539813,en.php

Of course, I didn't expect to come up with a solution to the problem.
