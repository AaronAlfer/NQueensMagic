# N Queens Magic
*A program that solves the N Queens puzzle*
## Introduction
So I was figuring out how to program my own chess engine, and suddenly I stumbled upon an article saying that some Math institute offers $1M to anyone who can 'solve a chess puzzle'. It had something to do with the P vs NP problem, and the thing was a bit trickier than what the title suggested (who would guess).

You can find out more about the issue here: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2017/title,1539813,en.php
And here: http://claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem

Of course, I didn't expect to come up with a solution to the problem. But it made me curious: I thought, maybe I could experiment and arrive at some interesting conclusions. 'Thanks' to the media, I misenterpreted the problem thinking that one needs to invent an algorithm that finds ALL solutions to the puzzle (starting from an empty board) really fast. For example, the standard 8 Queens puzzle has 92 unique solutions. So, to my understanding, the algorithm was supposed to find all of them, and then store them somehow. That wasn't quite the case, and I'll explain in a minute.

At first, I tried to come up with a non-conventional way of placing 8 queens so that the combination ends up being one of the 12 fundamental solutions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle#Solutions).
